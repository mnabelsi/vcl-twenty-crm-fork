# Zoho CRM Sync (Twenty app)

Two-way sync of Zoho CRM Contacts and Accounts with Twenty People and Companies for the self-hosted Twenty at mycrm.vcl.solutions. README.md explains the behaviour for the owner; SETUP.md the local server and the fake Zoho.

Rules for this app:

- Never change a `universalIdentifier` in `src/constants/universal-identifiers.ts`: the sync deletes and recreates the entity, with its data (the Zoho links on every record).
- A record is in step when the fingerprint of its synced values (`personFingerprint`, `companyFingerprint` in `src/sync/mapping.ts`) equals the stored `zohoSyncHash`. Anything added to the synced values must read the same from both sides, or the sync ping-pongs: add a round-trip test in `src/__tests__/mapping.test.ts`.
- Zoho only receives the fields that differ (`zohoContactChanges`, `zohoAccountChanges`); never send a whole record over a Zoho value the app cannot read.
- The sync never deletes, on either side. The role has no delete permission; keep it that way.
- People and companies Twenty creates from emails and calendar events (`createdBy.source` EMAIL or CALENDAR) are not pushed to Zoho unless already linked.
- Runtime packages are bundled into the functions, so keep them in `devDependencies`: a package in `dependencies` makes the Twenty server download it from npm before the functions can run.
- Fixtures and the fake Zoho use fictitious people and companies only.
- Checks: `yarn lint && yarn typecheck && yarn test:unit`; `yarn test` installs the app on a running Twenty; end to end with the fake Zoho per SETUP.md.

## UUID requirement

- All generated UUIDs must be valid UUID v4.

## Common Pitfalls

- Creating a view without a navigationMenuItem associated. This will make the view available on the left sidebar.
- Creating a front-end component that has a scroll instead of being responsive to its fixed widget height and width, unless it is specifically meant to be used in a canvas tab.

## Best practice

It's highly recommended to create new app entities using `yarn twenty dev:add`. These are the options:

| Entity type          | Command                                  | Generated file                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Object               | `yarn twenty dev:add object`             | `src/objects/<name>.ts`               |
| Field                | `yarn twenty dev:add field`              | `src/fields/<name>.ts`                |
| Logic function       | `yarn twenty dev:add logicFunction`      | `src/logic-functions/<name>.ts`       |
| Front component      | `yarn twenty dev:add frontComponent`     | `src/front-components/<name>.tsx`     |
| Role                 | `yarn twenty dev:add role`               | `src/roles/<name>.ts`                 |
| Skill                | `yarn twenty dev:add skill`              | `src/skills/<name>.ts`                |
| Agent                | `yarn twenty dev:add agent`              | `src/agents/<name>.ts`                |
| View                 | `yarn twenty dev:add view`               | `src/views/<name>.ts`                 |
| Navigation menu item | `yarn twenty dev:add navigationMenuItem` | `src/navigation-menu-items/<name>.ts` |
| Page layout          | `yarn twenty dev:add pageLayout`         | `src/page-layouts/<name>.ts`          |
| Page layout tab      | `yarn twenty dev:add pageLayoutTab`      | `src/page-layout-tabs/<name>.ts`      |
| Command menu item    | `yarn twenty dev:add commandMenuItem`    | `src/command-menu-items/<name>.ts`    |
| View field           | `yarn twenty dev:add viewField`          | `src/view-fields/<name>.ts`           |
| Connection provider  | `yarn twenty dev:add connectionProvider` | `src/connection-providers/<name>.ts`  |

This helps automatically generate required IDs etc.
